# What Is Going To Happen?

You will come to the Violet Hour.  You will eat.  You will drink.  You will be merry.  If you are so moved, you may make a toast.

# Will there be some sort of ceremony?

No

# What should I wear?
Dress like you're going to a fancy cocktail bar.  Hawaiian shirts encouraged.  If you're a dude, you have to wear close-toed shoes or the Violet Hour will heckle you.

# Will there be tacos?
Heck yes!
