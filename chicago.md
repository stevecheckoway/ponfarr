Chicago is the third largest city in the US!  It is great.  Here are some things we like, organized by Blue Line Stop.

# Logan Square

Lula Cafe - delicious, slightly pricey brunch/lunch with delicious cocktails and good coffee.  Insanely crowded on weekends, 30-45 minute wait but you can sometimes score a seat at the bar.

Wolfbait and B-girls - super cute little shop that sells only Chicago made-things.  Clothes, jewelry, kitchen stuff.

G-mart Comics - super cute local comic store.  They have a good indie and webcomic selection.

Billy Sunday - Cocktail bar.  They have a drink called The (something I can’t remember) Egg that has tomato in it and is like a super delicious alcoholic soup.  Also they have every kind of fernet ever.

Longman and Eagle - Delicious whiskey drinks plus good food!  Lots of weird meats.  They only have one vegan option (a lentil cauliflower thing), but it’s DELICIOUS.  Also they have really good tea.

Lost Lake - Tiki bar with incredibly good drinks AND out of control garnish game.  Our favorite bar in Chicago, it’s the best.  They have a regular drinks menu AND a secret drinks menu.  You can also get snacks from the Chinese restuarant next door.

Dill Pickle Co-op - Hippie food co-op.  Lots of vegan treats.  Can be a little expensive.  Hippie dudes who work here are always really excited about whatever you’re buying.  

# California

Chicago Diner - vegetarian restaurant, get the reuben!  They’re known for their seitan.  Also they have really good gravy.  Also milkshakes.

Boilerroom - Really good beer selection, decent drinks, vegan (and regular) pizza.  They’re cash only, but if you use their atm and show them the receipt they’ll give you a free shot.  Known for the P,B&J - a shot of Jameson, a Pabst Blue Ribbon, and a slice of pizza, all for around $8.

Revolution Brewery - Local Chicago brewery.  Also serves pretty good food.  Okay vegan options.

Galerie F - Art gallery that focuses on prints (especially show posters) and street art.  Lots of good Chicago themed stuff and local artists.  Good place for reasonably priced art.

Cafe Mustache - EXTREMELY HIPSTER coffee shop that is also a bar at night.  They have at least 4 kinds of malort.

# Western

Paladar - Cuban restaurant with vegan options (!!) and all of the kinds of rum ever

Logan Hardware - It’s a barcade!  They have pinball!  Including the Star Trek pinball machine I like.  And beer!  Not to be confused with the Logan Hardware that’s a record store.  (As far as I know, there’s no Logan Hardware that’s a hardware store.)

# Damen

Wicker park!  Super hipstery, lots of cute shops/restaurants/bars 

The Violet Hour - the classic Chicago cocktail revival bar.  If you come on a weekend, there’s gonna be a line.  If you wear flipflops and you’re a dude, they’ll give you shit.  BUT the drinks are delicious.  So, so delicious.  Get something with the tobacco bitters.  If you see Andrew the bartender, tell him we say hi.  There’s no sign on the outside, so look for the hanging light and the unobtrusive door.  (This is where the party will be)

Dimo’s Pizza - Vegan mac and cheese on a pizza.  WHAT WHAT.  This place is ridiculous and delicious and usually has 2-3 different kinds of vegan slices going.  Also has meat pizza.  

Tamale Spaceship - There’s only one kind of vegan tamale here, but that is much, much better than zero.  Also delicious guac.

Handlebar - Hipster vegetarian restaurant.  Has vegan fried pickles.  Is delicious. 

The Wormhole Coffee - hipster coffee shop with an 80s scifi theme.  Has a delorean.

Stan’s Donuts - They have vegan donuts!  Also regular donuts!

# The Loop

The Bean - Official name is “cloud gate.”  Giant mirrored public sculpture.  Taking a selfie in it is a Chicago must.  In millenium park

Architecture Boat Tour - I did this and it was super great.  Boat around the river and look at all the giant skyscrapers and hear about their architecture.  Leaves from Navy Pier

Hancock Tower Lounge - As good a view as the Sears observation lounge, but doesn’t cost $35 and doesn’t have a line.  Buy a drink and enjoy the view!

Teagschwendner - Giant German loose leaf tea shop, also sells brewed tea.  Specializes in black teas, but has everything.  Overwhelming.

Field Museum - Awesome natural history museum.  Has Sue the T-Rex.
